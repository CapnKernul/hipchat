h1. HipChat Wrapper

A very basic wrapper for the HipChat HTTP API.

h2. Usage

bc.. client = HipChat::Client.new(api_token)
notify_users = false
client['my room'].send('username', 'A message!', notify_users)

h2. Capistrano

bc.. require 'hipchat/capistrano'

set :hipchat_token, "<your token>"
set :hipchat_room_name, "Your room"
set :hipchat_announce, false # notify users

h3. Who did it?

To determine the user that is currently running the deploy, the capistrano tasks will look for the following:

# The $HIPCHAT_USER environment variable
# The hipchat_human capistrano var.
# The $USER environment variable.

If you set

bc. set :hipchat_human, :from_git

the user name will be taken from your git config (user.name). Note that whatever you put in
@hipchat_human@, @$HIPCHAT_USER@ always prevails.
